When you submit a batch job on an HPC system, like the one you're using, you typically receive a job ID (in this case, `7418348`) after submitting the job. Now, the job will be queued and eventually run on a compute node. Here's what you should do next:

Default memory is 8GiGs

To submit a job:

    sbatch run/gpu_batch.sh

Check Job ID/Active Jobs:

   squeue -u $USER

Check Job Status:

   squeue --job 7418348

This will give you information about the job's current state (whether it's running, pending, etc.).

Monitor Logs:
   
   tail -f /path/to/output.log
   tail -f /path/to/error.log
   
   Adjust the paths based on where you have specified your output and error logs in the batch script.

Check Completed Jobs:
   squeue --job 7418348
   
   Or you can check the completed jobs in the job history with:
   
   sacct -j 7418348

Cancel a job

    scancel 7418348

Check JOB history

   sacct -u $USER --starttime=2025-03-25
